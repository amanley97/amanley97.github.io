Hello All! My name is Alex, and I am a Master's Candidate in Computer Engineering at the University of Kansas. I am currently co-advised by [Dr. Heechul Yun](https://www.ittc.ku.edu/~heechul/) (University of Kansas) and [Dr. Mohammad Alian](https://alian.csl.cornell.edu/) (Cornell University) in the Computer Systems Lab.

My primary interests are in Computer Architecture, Hardware System Design, and Machine Learning Assisted Design. Throughout my studies, I have gained a deep understanding of advanced hardware topics, programming, and computer system simulations. Please check out my [research page](/research/) for more details!

In my free time, I enjoy hiking and admiring the great outdoors, as well as engaging in carpentry projects. Recently, I spent time learning electrical, plumbing, painting, and finish work while building my family's rural barndominium.

In the future, I hope to join the big tech industry and contribute to cutting-edge processing at the forefront of technology!
