Throughout the semester, we built a drivable RC-style car controlled by a SiFive microcontroller. We developed functions for driving and turning, created a UART interface for communication between a Raspberry Pi and the microcontroller, and wrote Python scripts to control the car. An extra feature allowed the car to be controlled via keyboard arrow keys.

**Skills:** C and Python Programming
