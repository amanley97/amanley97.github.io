For our senior design capstone, we designed and built a modular alarm system. The goal was to create a simple wireless alarm system allowing the user to dynamically set up their environment based on their needs. The system is optimal for users like apartment/office renters who may not have the option to place wires through walls to install a traditional alarm system. Additionally, the system features facial recognition for deactivating the alarm, making it cutting edge and useful in various situations.

**Role:** Team Leader - Coordinated hardware and software teams, ensured project goals were achieved, and provided assistance as needed.

**Technologies used:**
* Raspberry Pi (Python GUI)
* Facial Recognition (OpenCV)
* ESP32 (Bluetooth)

**Skills:** Python Programming, System Design, Hardware Prototyping, Wireless Communication
