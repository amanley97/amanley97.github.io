### The Future of Computer Architecture
**Project:** Mastering Computer Architecture through Guided Simulation

This project is developing an educational training platform to teach the next generation of computer architects. See more information on the project [here](https://eecs.ku.edu/eecs-professors-receive-200000-nsf-award-develop-ai-driven-computer-architecture-learning-tool). See information on the NSF funding [here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2327971&HistoricalAwards=false).

Three modules make up this project:
* **gEMA: gem5 Extended Modules API** - A standardized interface developed to allow gem5 to be integrated into any external program.
    * View the open source code [here](https://github.com/amanley97/gEMA).
    * gEMA is under review for contribution to mainline gem5!

* **SimScholar:** A GUI Platform to allow users to create and run gem5 simulations with ease.
    * View the open source code [here](https://github.com/amanley97/SimScholar)

* **SystemSavant:** An AI model to offer system insights based on user programs
    * > Updates coming soon!
