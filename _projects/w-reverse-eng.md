### Motor Controller Reverse Engineering
* **Problem:** A commonly repaired motor controller board lacked complete documentation on schematics, part lists, and board layout.
* **Solution:** Designed a schematic and expanded documentation for the board, allowing for a $1,200 cost saving per board and a 50% increase in repair time due to improved technician diagnosis.

### Conveyor Test Loop Reverse Engineering
* **Problem:** A recently acquired conveyor belt test loop lacked adequate documentation and had operational issues.
* **Solution:** Took a system-wide approach to assist in understanding the conveyor belt system, leading to rewritten documentation and fixed issues. Additionally, redesigned the loop interface to allow a technician to change the conveyor loop speed 100x faster, potentially leading to presets to emulate systems in other postal facilities.
