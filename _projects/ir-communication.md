In this computer engineering project, we designed a system to wirelessly transmit data using infrared pulses. The project involved a transmitter and receiver using Arduino microcontrollers to encode and decode data. The transmitter generated data packets transmitted via an infrared LED array, while the receiver detected transmission rates, captured data, and determined error rates.

**Skills:** C Programming
