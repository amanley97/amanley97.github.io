We designed a custom frequency filter with a Low Pass, 6kHz cutoff, and 5V Gain. We calculated the required resistances using datasheets, prototyped the filter on a breadboard, and tested it. Once confirmed, we designed the board in OrCAD and acid-etched it. After soldering, we had a completed filter.

**Skills:** Circuit Design, PCB Software
