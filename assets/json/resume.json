It wasn't uncommon for Alex to be assigned to several different projects and had to learn the details with little guidance. His ability to adapt and then deliver upon these projects made him a dependable team player. In addition, Alex felt comfortable providing recommendations for initiatives or processes that were outside his assigned tasks. Any organization would be lucky to have him as part of the team."}],"volunteer":[],"awards":[{"title":"Undergraduate Research Fellowship","date":"February 2022","awarder":"The University of Kansas","summary":"Prestigious program to develop young undergraduate researchers."},{"title":"Undergraduate Research Award","date":"December 2021","awarder":"The University of Kansas","summary":"Nominated to continue research."},{"title":"Undergraduate Research Award","date":"March 2021","awarder":"The University of Kansas","summary":"Nominated by faculty member for research efforts."},{"title":"Undergraduate Distinction Scholarship","date":"February 2022","awarder":"The University of Kansas","summary":"Awarded for excellence in academics."},{"title":"Eagle Scout","date":"May 2018","awarder":"Boy Scouts of America","summary":""},{"title":"Medal of Merit","date":"June 2018","awarder":"Boy Scouts of America","summary":""}],"publications":[{"name":"Profiling gem5 Simulator","publisher":"2023 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS)","releaseDate":"2023","url":"","summary":"J.
